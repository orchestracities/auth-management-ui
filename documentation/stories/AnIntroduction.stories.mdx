# Auth-Management UI For Anubis


 <Subtitle >Introduction: what the Auth-Management UI is about</Subtitle>

The Webapp is to provide an intuitive UI for [Anubis policy-api](https://github.com/orchestracities/anubis) using the language of [Material for you](https://m3.material.io/) (or Material v3) and the help of [MUI](https://mui.com/) in order to have an intuitive and a familiar look and feel for the end user.

In this section we are going to cover the documentation of the react components inside the app, and how to interact with them.

The UI was builded with a [component-driven](https://componentdriven.org) process, every component can be redered by it's own withouth nesting properties

<Subtitle >How this documentation is structured:</Subtitle>

This documentation is structured by components, every **components** type has a section based of the usage there are for examples components related to the `Tenants or the Policies` but also component that are `Shared between sections`.

Every component is **documented with a canvas** to test it in a controlled envroinment, but also see it visually speaking.

It's also possibile to **see the Docs section** and read about the usage of the components, and the **properties** related to them. Every property has the type the default values and the description about it.


 <Subtitle >What external libraries the app is using:</Subtitle>

 The **Auth-Management UI For Anubis** is using [MUI or material UI](https://mui.com/) for most of the grid and components with the last version of the theme engine with some customization, but the goal was to create a clean code that can be understood with a simple reading of the MUI documentation.

 A part from that the app is also using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as an http client, and [apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) for the graphql implementation.

 The client authentication part is done with [react oidc](https://github.com/AxaGuilDEv/react-oidc) with OpenID as a standard.

 [React router](https://reactrouter.com/) is also used.

 <Subtitle >How the components are created:</Subtitle>

 The components inside the app are all pure functional components created using [react hooks](https://en.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) this choice was made for rendering reasons and to make the components **less dependable on states**.
 
 Every component can be used in an isolated way, so if a change is needed or if the copmponent should be rendered with a different type of data inside another page this could be achived without changing the entire nesting architecture.


<Subtitle >What is the App structure:</Subtitle>

The App structure is composed in this order:

 **-App.js**

  **-pages**

   **-components**

The App.js page is managing the login and the main data inside the states, the pages are done by pure components
